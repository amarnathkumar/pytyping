PyTyping is a Linux program that plays sounds when typing; by default typewriter sounds. I wrote this because I couldn't find a comparable application for Linux, while it was available on Windows and Mac.

PyTyping can be used as auditory feedback for touch typing, or just because it sounds cool!

DPENDENCIES
- python
- python-xlib
- python-gst0.10
- python-gobject

RUNNING
PyTyping can be run in a terminal by executing "python PATH_TO_FILES/typing.py", or can be run at startup by adding to startup programs. In Ubuntu this is done using the Startup Applications preference.

SOUNDS
The default typing sound can be replaced by replacing the type.wav file in the same directory as typing.py.
